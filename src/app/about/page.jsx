            Angry Uncle Bot is a web app that helps you practice having hard conversationsâ€”with family, friends, 
            or anyone who sees the world differently. Powered by GPT, it simulates real-time, 
            emotionally charged discussions so you can learn to stay calm, listen actively, 
            and respond thoughtfully. Every interaction is dynamic, personal, and unpredictable, just like real life.
